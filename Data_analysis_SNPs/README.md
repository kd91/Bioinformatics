# Data Analysis using R - Relation of SNPs to disease

Description:

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) may be quantified as predictor variables in order to look for associations with a given phenotype, such as a disease.

For this project we will utilize R to investigate the dataset disease2a.csv containing genomic data on 2000 individuals, some of whom have the disease and some of whom do not. 

It includes data exploration, visuazlizations and fitting of a regression models to explore the relationship of SNPs to the disease.


Notes: 
Each row contains data on one individual. There are 10 predictor variables: these are SNPs encoded as number of mutated alleles for the gene. The class variable indicates for each person whether they have disease (1 if they have it, zero if not).
